/*
QAbstractSocket::ConnectionRefusedError             0	The connection was refused by the peer (or timed out).
QAbstractSocket::RemoteHostClosedError              1	The remote host closed the connection. Note that the client socket (i.e., this socket) will be closed after the remote close notification has been sent.
QAbstractSocket::HostNotFoundError                  2	The host address was not found.
QAbstractSocket::SocketAccessError                  3	The socket operation failed because the application lacked the required privileges.
QAbstractSocket::SocketResourceError                4	The local system ran out of resources (e.g., too many sockets).
QAbstractSocket::SocketTimeoutError                 5	The socket operation timed out.
QAbstractSocket::DatagramTooLargeError              6	The datagram was larger than the operating system's limit (which can be as low as 8192 bytes).
QAbstractSocket::NetworkError                       7	An error occurred with the network (e.g., the network cable was accidentally plugged out).
QAbstractSocket::AddressInUseError                  8	The address specified to QAbstractSocket::bind() is already in use and was set to be exclusive.
QAbstractSocket::SocketAddressNotAvailableError     9	The address specified to QAbstractSocket::bind() does not belong to the host.
QAbstractSocket::UnsupportedSocketOperationError	10	The requested socket operation is not supported by the local operating system (e.g., lack of IPv6 support).
QAbstractSocket::ProxyAuthenticationRequiredError	12	The socket is using a proxy, and the proxy requires authentication.
QAbstractSocket::SslHandshakeFailedError            13	The SSL/TLS handshake failed, so the connection was closed (only used in QSslSocket)
QAbstractSocket::UnfinishedSocketOperationError     11	Used by QAbstractSocketEngine only, The last operation attempted has not finished yet (still in progress in the background).
QAbstractSocket::ProxyConnectionRefusedError        14	Could not contact the proxy server because the connection to that server was denied
QAbstractSocket::ProxyConnectionClosedError         15	The connection to the proxy server was closed unexpectedly (before the connection to the final peer was established)
QAbstractSocket::ProxyConnectionTimeoutError        16	The connection to the proxy server timed out or the proxy server stopped responding in the authentication phase.
QAbstractSocket::ProxyNotFoundError                 17	The proxy address set with setProxy() (or the application proxy) was not found.
QAbstractSocket::ProxyProtocolError                 18	The connection negotiation with the proxy server failed, because the response from the proxy server could not be understood.
QAbstractSocket::OperationError                     19	An operation was attempted while the socket was in a state that did not permit it.
QAbstractSocket::SslInternalError                   20	The SSL library being used reported an internal error. This is probably the result of a bad installation or misconfiguration of the library.
QAbstractSocket::SslInvalidUserDataError            21	Invalid data (certificate, key, cypher, etc.) was provided and its use resulted in an error in the SSL library.
QAbstractSocket::TemporaryError                     22	A temporary error occurred (e.g., operation would block and socket is non-blocking).
QAbstractSocket::UnknownSocketError                 -1	An unidentified error occurred.
